# Annotation guidelines (ver. 1.0):

This ontology describes labels employed the annotation of noun semantics in the TAM_nominal_evaluation process.
The ontology is loosely based on WordNet supersenses and T-PAS.

Nouns are annotated at the type level (i.e., out of their context).

## Classes:

## Residual Cases

* the tag `-` identifies cases where the evaluation does not happen along TAM dimensions and annotation is therefore irrelevant
* the tag `?` identifies ambiguous cases
* the tag `UNKNOWN` identifies cases where the annotation has not yet been performed
